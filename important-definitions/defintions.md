## Learning resources — Java, HTML & JavaScript

Below are curated resources (websites, courses, books, and apps) and short learning paths for Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Pick one interactive course + one reference and build small projects as you learn.

### Java
- Beginner:
	- Oracle Java Tutorials — official, authoritative (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
	- Codecademy / JetBrains Academy — interactive hands-on tracks
	- Book: "Head First Java" — beginner-friendly and project-focused
- Intermediate / Best practices:
	- "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch — patterns and idioms
	- Baeldung (https://www.baeldung.com/) — articles and examples for Spring and core Java
- Tools & IDEs:
	- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (free) — industry-standard for Java
	- OpenJDK / Oracle JDK and Maven or Gradle for builds
- Suggested mini-projects: console apps, a small REST API (Spring Boot), or a CLI file parser

### HTML & CSS (front-end basics)
- Beginner:
	- freeCodeCamp — Responsive Web Design certification (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
	- MDN Web Docs — HTML, CSS reference and guides (https://developer.mozilla.org/)
	- Codecademy — interactive HTML/CSS track
- Intermediate / Layouts:
	- CSS-Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/) — practical layouts, Flexbox and Grid guides
	- Udemy or Coursera courses for building responsive sites
- Tools & playgrounds:
	- Live Server extension for VS Code — quick local reloads
	- CodePen / JSFiddle for rapid prototyping
- Suggested mini-projects: personal homepage, responsive portfolio, simple landing page

### JavaScript (language + DOM + modern web)
- Beginner:
	- MDN Web Docs — JavaScript guide and reference
	- freeCodeCamp — JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
	- Book: "Eloquent JavaScript" (online free) — practical exercises and projects
- Intermediate / Modern JS:
	- "You Don't Know JS (Yet)" series — deep dive into the language
	- Frontend frameworks: official docs (React, Vue, Svelte) when ready
	- Courses: Wes Bos, Frontend Masters for modern patterns
- Tools & runtimes:
	- Node.js + npm — run JS tooling and small servers
	- Chrome DevTools — debugging and performance inspection
	- Bundlers: Vite, Webpack (learn basics when needed)
- Playgrounds and quick testing:
	- REPL.it / Replit, CodeSandbox, JSFiddle, CodePen
- Suggested mini-projects: to-do app, weather fetcher using public API, interactive form

### Mobile apps and bite-sized learning
- SoloLearn — short interactive lessons for many languages (Java, HTML, JS)
- Mimo — micro-lessons and small daily challenges
- Enki — daily bite-sized programming lessons
- Grasshopper (by Google) — beginner JavaScript puzzles

### Practical tips & learning path
- Start with fundamentals: syntax, data types, and core APIs (DOM for web, basic I/O for Java).
- Build small projects early — real experience is faster than tutorials alone.
- Use an editor you like (VS Code or IntelliJ) and learn its debugger and live reload.
- Version control: create a GitHub repo for each project and push early; commit small changes.
- Expand by combining skills: for example, use Java backend + JavaScript frontend or static HTML + JS widgets.

### Next steps you might want me to do
- Convert this list into a JSON or markdown checklist in the repo.
- Add a minimal learning-plan README that links to example projects in this workspace.
- Create a small starter template (HTML + JS or simple Java Maven project) under a new folder.

*(If you'd like, tell me which topic you want structured as a weekly plan and I can add a 4–8 week roadmap and starter projects.)*
